# Tab opener
A super simple interface to let you paste in a line-separated list of URLs to open into new tabs in your browser. 

## Live page: https://offsetchris.github.io/tabOpener/

Tested to work with Chrome 78 and Firefox 69

## Usage
- The user must allow pop-ups on the site to successfully open multiple tabs
  - Each browser is unique in how they handle popup blocking. Please reference your browser's docs on how to always allow popups for the site.
- Each URL must be on its own line in the textarea
- Each URL must contain the protocol (http://)
- Any extraneous characters in the text area will result in errors
